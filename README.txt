About this Project
------------------
This project was completed on 29 May 2016 as the 5th coding project in the COEN 12 Abstract Data Types and Data Structures course at Santa Clara University. "tree.c" and "huffman.c" were written by Ray Che, building off of the included source files provided by Professor Darren C. Atkinson of the Computer Science and Engineering department. This source code is only to be used as an example of Ray Che's programming ability and shall not be used to assist other students attempting to complete the same project at Santa Clara University. Using this project in the latter manner is academic dishonesty and a violation of the student conduct code.
